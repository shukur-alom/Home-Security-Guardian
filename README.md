# Home Security Guardian

The **Home Security Guardian** is an innovative theft detection and notification system designed to protect your home or property when you're not present. It uses motion sensors, Arduino technology, and a GSM 900A module to detect unauthorized intruders and immediately notify you through a phone call.

## Key Features

- **Motion Detection**: Advanced motion sensors monitor your premises for any unauthorized movement.

- **Arduino Control**: When an intrusion is detected, the system triggers an Arduino microcontroller, initiating the alert process.

- **Remote Notification**: Utilizing a GSM 900A module, the system can send an instant alert to your mobile phone.

- **Customizable Alerts**: Receive a phone call notification on your mobile device when a potential theft is detected.

## How It Works

1. When the system detects motion, the motion sensor sends a signal to the Arduino microcontroller.

2. The Arduino processes this signal and activates the alert mechanism.

3. The GSM 900A module is used to establish a phone call to your specified mobile number.

4. Upon answering the call, you will receive a notification about the potential intrusion.

## Installation

- **Hardware**: Connect the motion sensors, Arduino, and GSM 900A module as per the provided schematic.

- **Software**: Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.

## Usage

1. Activate the system when leaving your home or property.

2. If an unauthorized person enters the premises, the system will detect motion.

3. The system will call your mobile phone, alerting you to the possible intrusion.

## Dependencies

- Arduino IDE for uploading the code to the microcontroller.
- Appropriate GSM 900A module libraries if required.
